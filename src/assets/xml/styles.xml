    <PROFILE>Aroma: Clean, medium spicy, floral or herbal hop aroma.
      Appearance: Very pale straw to pale yellow color. White, frothy head seldom persists. Very clear.
      Flavor: Low to moderate levels of grainy-malt flavor, with a crisp, dry, well-attenuated finish. The grain
      character can be somewhat neutral, or show a light bready-crackery quality or up to moderate corny or malty
      sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none to medium levels, and often showing a floral, spicy, or herbal character if
      detected. Hop bitterness at medium-low to medium level. Balance may vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter,
      but is relatively close to even. Neutral aftertaste with light malt and sometimes hop flavors. A light amount of
      DMS is not a fault.
      Mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Moderately high to highly carbonated. Can have a slight carbonic bite on the
      tongue.

      body and carbonation. Usually hazy.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate intensity of German malt, typically rich, bready, somewhat toasty, with light bread crust
      notes. Moderately-low to moderate spicy peppery hop aroma. Very low to low diacetyl, occasionally low to
      moderately-low sulfur and very low green apple or other yeast-derived notes.
      Appearance: Moderately cloudy to clear depending on age, but never extremely cloudy or murky. Gold to deep
      reddish-amber color. Off-white, creamy head.
      Flavor: Initial malt flavor may suggest sweetness, but finish is moderately dry to dry, and slightly bitter.
      Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes a bready-toasty aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately
      high, and spicy or herbal hop flavor is low to moderately high. Balance can be either on the malt or hop side, but
      the finish is not sweet.
      Mouthfeel: Medium body, with a creamy texture and medium carbonation. Fully fermented, without a sweet or cloying
      impression.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Grist varies, although traditional German versions emphasize pale and color malt. The notion of
      elegance is derived from the high-quality local ingredients, particularly the malts. Spalt or other typically
      spicy local hops are most common.

    <NOTES>Clean yet robust and complex aroma of grainy-rich malt, with baked bread and nutty-toasty character. Some
      spicy hop aroma with restrained esters. Hop bitterness is present but balanced by a clean and crisp malt
      character. Medium body and carbonation.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma which can be grainy, with a very low to moderate caramel-sweet to
      toasty-malty aroma. Hop aroma can range from low to none with a mildly floral or spicy character. Clean lager
      profile.
      Appearance: Golden-amber to reddish-copper color. Bright clarity. White to off-white foam stand which may not
      last.
      Flavor: Moderate malt profile which can vary from dry to grainy-sweet. Low to moderate levels of caramel and
      toasty-bready notes can be evident. Low to medium-low corny sweetness is optional, but not a fault. Hop bitterness
      is low to moderate, and hop flavor is low to moderate with a spicy, herbal, or floral character. The balance can
      be fairly malty to nearly even, with the bitterness becoming more noticeable but not objectionable. The bitterness
      level can increase if the malt character increases to match. Clean fermentation profile.
      Mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Medium to high carbonation. Smooth; some examples can be creamy.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Two-row or six-row base malt. Color malts such as victory, amber, etc. Caramel malt adjuncts. European

    <NOTES>Moderate malt aroma, typically rich, bready, somewhat toasty character of german malt. No hop aroma. Initial
      malt flavour suggests sweetness, but finishes dry.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate malty richness, with an emphasis on toasty-doughy aromatics and an impression of sweetness.
      Low to medium-low floral, herbal, or spicy hops. The malt should not have a deeply toasted, caramel, or biscuity
      quality. Clean lager fermentation character.
      Appearance: Deep yellow to amber hues. Bright clarity. Persistent white to off-white foam stand. Most commercial
      examples are medium gold in color.
      Flavor: Medium to medium-high malty flavor initially, with a lightly toasty, bread dough quality and an impression
      of soft sweetness. Medium to medium-low bitterness, definitely malty in the balance. Well-attenuated and crisp,
      but not dry. Medium-low to medium floral, herbal, or spicy hop flavor. Clean lager fermentation character. The
      taste is mostly of Pils malt, but with slightly toasty hints. The bitterness is supportive, but still should yield
      a malty, flavorful finish.
      Mouthfeel: Medium body, with a smooth, somewhat creamy texture. Medium carbonation. Alcohol strength barely
      noticeable as warming, if at all.

    <NOTES>Deep malt sweetness, hints of chocolate, nuts or caramel. Low spicy, floral or herbal hop aroma. Clean and
      medium body with medium carbonation.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Little to medium malt aroma; may have a light corn character. Little to medium roast and caramel
      malt aroma. Hop aroma may range from none to light spicy or floral hop presence. While a clean fermentation
      profile is generally most desirable, low levels of yeast character (such as a light apple fruitiness) are not a
      fault.
      Appearance: Deep amber to dark brown with bright clarity and ruby highlights. Foam stand may not be long lasting,
      and is beige to light tan in color.
      Flavor: Low to medium malty sweetness with medium caramel and/or roasted malt flavors (and may include hints of
      coffee, molasses or cocoa). Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels, and is typically floral, spicy, or herbal.
      Low to medium hop bitterness. May have a very light fruitiness. Moderately crisp finish. The balance is typically
      somewhat malty.
      Mouthfeel: Light to medium-light body. Smooth with a light creaminess. Medium to high carbonation.

      Appearance: Deep gold to light amber in color. Bright to clear clarity. Large, creamy, persistent, white head.
      Flavor: Moderately to moderately strong grainy-sweet malt flavor dominates with some toasty notes and/or Maillard
      products providing added interest. Little to no caramel flavors. May have a light DMS flavor. Moderate to no hop
      flavor (spicy, herbal, floral, peppery). Moderate hop bitterness (more so in the balance than in other bocks).
      Clean fermentation profile. Well-attenuated, not cloying, with a moderately-dry finish that may taste of both malt
      and hops.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation. Smooth and clean with no harshness or
      astringency, despite the increased hop bitterness. A light alcohol warming may be present.

    <NOTES>High to intense hop aroma, featuring american hops, with citrusy, floral, resinous and tropical fruit aroma.
      Low malt character and very clean fermentation showcasts hops. Low residual sweetness and lingering bitterness.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate to strong hop aroma from American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of possible
      characteristics, including citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon.
      None of these specific characteristics are required, but hops should be apparent. Low to moderate maltiness
      supports the hop presentation. Clean fermentation.
      Appearance: Pale golden to light amber. Moderately large white to off-white head with good retention. Generally
      quite clear, although dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.
      Flavor: Moderate to high hop flavor, typically showing an American or New World hop character (citrus, floral,
      pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). Low to moderate clean grainy-malt
      character supports the hop presentation. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into the finish, but the
      aftertaste should generally be clean and not harsh. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this
      character should not be excessive.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to high carbonation. Overall smooth finish without astringency
      and harshness.

    <PROFILE>Aroma: Typically showcases rustic, traditional American hops (often with woody, rustic or minty qualities)
      in moderate to high strength. Light fruitiness acceptable. Low to moderate caramel and/or toasty malt aromatics
      support the hops.
      Appearance: Medium amber to light copper color. Generally clear. Moderate off-white head with good retention.
      Flavor: Moderately malty with a pronounced hop bitterness. The malt character is usually toasty (not roasted) and
      caramelly. Low to moderately high hop flavor, usually showing rustic, traditional American hop qualities (often
      woody, rustic, minty). Finish fairly dry and crisp, with a lingering hop bitterness and a firm, grainy malt
      flavor. Light fruity esters are acceptable, but otherwise clean.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high carbonation.

    <INGREDIENTS>Pale ale malt, non-citrusy hops (often Northern Brewer), small amounts of toasted malt and/or crystal
      malts. Lager yeast; however, some strains (often with the mention of California in the name) work better than
      others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55 to 60 °F) typically used. Note that some German yeast strains
      produce inappropriate sulfury character.

    <NOTES>Rich, malty aroma with a presence of alcohol. Some dark fruit esters. Hop bitterness balances the rich
      maltiness a bit. Full body and low carbonation.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Dominated by a balance of rich, intense malt and a definite alcohol presence. No hop aroma. May have
      significant malt-derived dark fruit esters. Alcohol aromas should not be harsh or solventy.
      Appearance: Deep copper to dark brown in color, often with attractive ruby highlights. Lagering should provide
      good clarity. Head retention may be moderate to poor. Off-white to deep ivory colored head. Pronounced legs are
      often evident.
      Flavor: Rich, sweet malt balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The malt can have Maillard products, toasty
      qualities, some caramel, and occasionally a slight chocolate flavor. No hop flavor. Hop bitterness just offsets
      the malt sweetness enough to avoid a cloying character. May have significant malt-derived dark fruit esters. The
      alcohol should be smooth, not harsh or hot, and should help the hop bitterness balance the strong malt presence.
      The finish should be of malt and alcohol, and can have a certain dryness from the alcohol. It should not be
      sticky, syrupy or cloyingly sweet. Clean lager character.
      Mouthfeel: Full to very full-bodied. Low carbonation. Significant alcohol warmth without sharp hotness. Very
      smooth without harsh edges from alcohol, bitterness, fusels, or other concentrated flavors.

    <NOTES>Rich, malty sweetness containing caramel, toffee, nut and toast notes. Some darker malt character like

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Rich malty sweetness often containing caramel, toffee, nutty to deep toast, and/or licorice notes.
      Complex alcohol and ester profile of moderate strength, and reminiscent of plums, prunes, raisins, cherries or
      currants, occasionally with a vinous Port-like quality. Some darker malt character that is deep chocolate, coffee
      or molasses but never burnt. No hops. No sourness. Very smooth.
      Appearance: Dark reddish-copper to opaque dark brown (not black). Thick, persistent tan-colored head. Clear,
      although darker versions can be opaque.
      Flavor: As with aroma, has a rich malty sweetness with a complex blend of deep malt, dried fruit esters, and
      alcohol. Has a prominent yet smooth schwarzbier-like roasted flavor that stops short of burnt. Mouth-filling and
      very smooth. Clean lager character. Starts sweet but darker malt flavors quickly dominates and persists through
      finish. Just a touch dry with a hint of roast coffee or licorice in the finish. Malt can have a caramel, toffee,
      nutty, molasses and/or licorice complexity. Light hints of black currant and dark fruits. Medium-low to medium
      bitterness from malt and hops, just to provide balance. Hop flavor from slightly spicy hops ranges from none to
      medium-low.
      Mouthfeel: Generally quite full-bodied and smooth, with a well-aged alcohol warmth. Medium to medium-high
      carbonation, making it seem even more mouth-filling. Not heavy on the tongue due to carbonation level.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Generally lager yeast (cold fermented if using ale yeast, as is required when brewed in Russia).
      Debittered chocolate or black malt. Munich or Vienna base malt. Continental hops (Saazer-type, typically). May

    <NOTES>Light malty aromas, possibly with light bready or caramel notes. Low to medium hop aroma. Low to medium
      bitterness. The Kölsch has to be brewed in the region of Cologne in Germany.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Low to very low malt aroma, with a grainy-sweet character. A pleasant, subtle fruit aroma from
      fermentation (apple, cherry or pear) is acceptable, but not always present. A low floral, spicy or herbal hop
      aroma is optional but not out of style. Some yeast strains may give a slight winy or sulfury character (this
      characteristic is also optional, but not a fault). Overall, the intensity of aromatics is fairly subtle but
      generally balanced, clean, and fresh.
      Appearance: Very pale gold to light gold. Very clear (authentic commercial versions are filtered to a brilliant
      clarity). Has a delicate white head that may not persist.
      Flavor: Soft, rounded palate comprised of a delicate flavor balance between soft yet attenuated malt, an almost
      imperceptible fruity sweetness from fermentation, and a medium-low to medium bitterness with a delicate dryness
      and slight crispness in the finish (but no harsh aftertaste). The malt tends to be grainy-sweet, possibly with a
      very light bready or honey quality. The hop flavor is variable, and can range from low to moderately-high; most
      are medium-low to medium intensity and have a floral, spicy, or herbal character. May have a malty-sweet
      impression at the start, but this is not required. No noticeable residual sweetness. May have a slightly winy,
      minerally, or sulfury accent that accentuates the dryness and flavor balance. A slight wheat taste is rare but not
      a fault. Otherwise, very clean.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body (most are medium-light). Medium to medium-high carbonation. Smooth and
      generally crisp and well-attenuated.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Traditional German hops (Hallertau, Tettnang, Spalt or Hersbrucker). German Pils or pale malt.
      Attenuative, clean ale yeast. Up to 20% wheat malt may be used, but this is quite rare in authentic versions.
      Current commercial practice is to ferment warm, cold condition for a short period of time, and serve young.

    <NOTES>Strong phenols and fruity esters, typically banana. Light to medium wheat aroma. Can have light vanilla or
      bubblegum character. High to very high carbonation. Also called Weissbier.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate to strong phenols (usually clove) and fruity esters (typically banana). The balance and
      intensity of the phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly
      prominent. The hop character ranges from low to none. A light to moderate wheat aroma (which might be perceived as
      bready or grainy) may be present but other malt characteristics should not. Optional, but acceptable, aromatics
      can include a light to moderate vanilla character, and/or a faint bubblegum aroma. None of these optional
      characteristics should be high or dominant, but often can add to the complexity and balance.
      Appearance: Pale straw to gold in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting white head is characteristic. The high
      protein content of wheat impairs clarity in an unfiltered beer, although the level of haze is somewhat variable.
      Flavor: Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor. The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester
      components can vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. Optionally, a very light
      to moderate vanilla character and/or faint bubblegum notes can accentuate the banana flavor, sweetness and
      roundness; neither should be dominant if present. The soft, somewhat bready or grainy flavor of wheat is
      complementary, as is a slightly grainy-sweet malt character. Hop flavor is very low to none, and hop bitterness is
      very low to moderately low. Well-rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish. The perception of
      sweetness is more due to the absence of hop bitterness than actual residual sweetness; a sweet or heavy finish
      would significantly impair drinkability.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body; never heavy. Suspended yeast may increase the perception of body. The
      texture of wheat imparts the sensation of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a light, spritzy finish
      aided by high to very high carbonation. Always effervescent.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>By German brewing tradition, at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat, although some versions use
      up to 70%; the remainder is typically Pilsner malt. A decoction mash is traditional, although modern brewers
      typically don't follow this practice. Weizen ale yeast produces the typical spicy and fruity character, although
      high fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.

    <NOTES>Grain flavor with zesty, orange-citrusy fruitiness, hints of coriander. Refreshingly crisp with a dry finish.
      Some bready wheat flavour. Medium-light body, high carbonation.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate malty sweetness (often with light notes of honey and/or vanilla) with light, grainy, spicy
      wheat aromatics, often with a bit of tartness. Moderate perfumy coriander, often with a complex herbal, spicy, or
      peppery note in the background. Moderate zesty, citrusy-orangey fruitiness. A low spicy-herbal hop aroma is
      optional, but should never overpower the other characteristics. Vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like aromas are
      inappropriate. Spices should blend in with fruity, floral and sweet aromas and should not be overly strong.
      Appearance: Very pale straw to very light gold in color. The beer will be very cloudy from starch haze and/or
      yeast, which gives it a milky, whitish-yellow appearance. Dense, white, moussy head. Head retention should be
      quite good.
      Flavor: Pleasant malty-sweet grain flavor (often with a honey and/or vanilla character) and a zesty,
      orange-citrusy fruitiness. Refreshingly crisp with a dry, often tart, finish. Can have a low bready wheat flavor.
      Optionally has a very light lactic-tasting sourness. Herbal-spicy flavors, which may include coriander and other
      spices, are common should be subtle and balanced, not overpowering. A spicy-earthy hop flavor is low to none, and
      if noticeable, never gets in the way of the spices. Hop bitterness is low to medium-low, and doesn't interfere
      with refreshing flavors of fruit and spice, nor does it persist into the finish. Bitterness from orange pith
      should not be present. Vegetal, celery-like, ham-like, or soapy flavors are inappropriate.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, often having a smoothness and light creaminess from unmalted wheat and the
      occasional oats. Despite body and creaminess, finishes dry and often a bit tart. Effervescent character from high
      carbonation. Refreshing, from carbonation, light acidity, and lack of bitterness in finish. No harshness or
      astringency from orange pith. Should not be overly dry and thin, nor should it be thick and heavy.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>About 50% unmalted wheat and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some
      versions, up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and Curaçao or sometimes sweet
      orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g., chamomile, cumin,
      cinnamon, Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent. Ale yeast prone to the
      production of mild, spicy flavors is very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation, or
      the actual addition of lactic acid, is done.

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate to strong hop aroma from American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of possible
      characteristics, including citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon.
      None of these specific characteristics are required, but hops should be apparent. Low to moderate maltiness
      supports the hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character (bready, toasty,
      biscuit, caramelly). Fruity esters vary from moderate to none. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes,
      although this character should not be excessive.
      Appearance: Pale golden to light amber. Moderately large white to off-white head with good retention. Generally
      quite clear, although dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.
      Flavor: Moderate to high hop flavor, typically showing an American or New World hop character (citrus, floral,
      pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). Low to moderate clean grainy-malt
      character supports the hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character
      (bready, toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late hops and bitterness, but the malt presence
      should be supportive, not distracting. Caramel flavors are often absent or fairly restrained (but are acceptable
      as long as they don't clash with the hops). Fruity yeast esters can be moderate to none, although many hop
      varieties are quite fruity. Moderate to high hop bitterness with a medium to dry finish. Hop flavor and bitterness
      often lingers into the finish, but the aftertaste should generally be clean and not harsh. Dry hopping (if used)
      may add grassy notes, although this character should not be excessive.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to high carbonation. Overall smooth finish without astringency
      and harshness.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Pale ale malt, typically North American two-row. American or New World hops, with a wide range of
      allowable characteristics. American or English ale yeast (neutral to lightly fruity). Specialty grains may add
      character and complexity, but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains that add malt
      flavor and richness, light sweetness, and toasty or bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to
      differentiate brands.

    <NOTES>Low to moderate hop aroma with American hops characteristics. Medium maltiness, with some caramel notes. Malt
      and hop bitterness are usually balanced. Medium body. The german Altbier is also an Amber Ale, called Alt, because
      of the older, top-fermenting yeast.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate malty-sweet to malty-rich aroma with chocolate, caramel, nutty, and/or toasty qualities.
      Hop aroma is typically low to moderate, of almost any variety that complements the malt. Some interpretations of
      the style may feature a stronger hop aroma, an American or New World hop character (citrusy, fruity, tropical,
      etc.), and/or a fresh dry-hopped aroma (all are optional). Fruity esters are moderate to very low. The dark malt
      character is more robust than other brown ales, yet stops short of being overly porter-like. The malt and hops are
      generally balanced.
      Appearance: Light to very dark brown color. Clear. Low to moderate off-white to light tan head.
      Flavor: Medium to moderately-high malty-sweet or malty-rich flavor with chocolate, caramel, nutty, and/or toasty
      malt complexity, with medium to medium-high bitterness. The medium to medium-dry finish provides an aftertaste
      having both malt and hops. Hop flavor can be light to moderate, and may optionally have a citrusy, fruity, or
      tropical character, although any hop flavor that complements the malt is acceptable. Very low to moderate fruity
      esters.
      Mouthfeel: Medium to medium-full body. More bitter versions may have a dry, resiny impression. Moderate to
      moderately-high carbonation.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Well-modified pale malt, plus crystal and darker malts (typically chocolate). American hops are

    <PROFILE>Aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma, either neutral-grainy or with a lightly caramelly-toasty-toffee
      character. May have a very light buttery character (although this is not required). Hop aroma is low earthy or
      floral to none (usually not present). Quite clean.
      Appearance: Medium amber to medium reddish-copper color. Clear. Low off-white to tan colored head, average
      persistence.
      Flavor: Moderate to very little caramel malt flavor and sweetness, rarely with a light buttered toast or
      toffee-like quality. The palate often is fairly neutral and grainy, or can take on a lightly toasty or biscuity
      note as it finishes with a light taste of roasted grain, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish. A
      light earthy or floral hop flavor is optional. Medium to medium-low hop bitterness. Medium-dry to dry finish.
      Clean and smooth. Little to no esters. The balance tends to be slightly towards the malt, although light use of
      roasted grains may increase the perception of bitterness slightly.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although examples containing low levels of diacetyl may have a slightly
      slick mouthfeel (not required). Moderate carbonation. Smooth. Moderately attenuated.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Generally has a bit of roasted barley or black malt to provide reddish color and dry roasted finish.

    <NOTES>Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex blend of dried-fruit, caramel, nuts, toffee and slight
      roasted malt. Low to moderate hop aroma, most often resinous, grassy or citrusy notes. American variants can have
      distinctive New World hop aroma. Medium dry to sweet finish. Low carbonation with full, creamy body.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex blend of dried-fruit, caramel, nuts, toffee,
      and/or other specialty malt aromas. Some alcohol notes are acceptable, but shouldn't be hot or solventy. Hop
      aromas can vary widely, but typically have earthy, resiny, fruity, and/or floral notes. The balance can vary
      widely, but most examples will have a blend of malt, fruit, hops, and alcohol in varying intensities.
      Appearance: Deep gold to dark reddish-brown color (many are fairly dark). Generally clear, although darker
      versions may be almost opaque. Moderate to low cream- to light tan-colored head; average retention.
      Flavor: Medium to high malt character often rich with nutty, toffee, or caramel flavors. Light chocolate notes are
      sometimes found in darker beers. May have interesting flavor complexity from brewing sugars. Balance is often
      malty, but may be well hopped, which affects the impression of maltiness. Moderate fruity esters are common, often
      with a dark fruit or dried fruit character. The finish may vary from medium dry to somewhat sweet. Alcoholic
      strength should be evident, though not overwhelming. Diacetyl low to none, and is generally not desirable.
      Mouthfeel: Medium to full, chewy body. Alcohol warmth is often evident and always welcome. Low to moderate
      carbonation. Smooth texture.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Grists vary, often based on pale malt with caramel and specialty malts. Some darker examples suggest
      that dark malts (e.g., chocolate, black malt) may be appropriate, though sparingly so as to avoid an overly
      roasted character. Sugary adjuncts are common, as are starchy adjuncts (maize, flaked barley, wheat). Finishing
      hops are traditionally English.

    <NOTES>Very rich and strong malt aroma with caramel and toffee notes, moderate fruitiness. Hop aroma present, more
      evidently in American versions. Prevalent alcohol strength, full bodied with low carbonation.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Very rich and strongly malty, often with a caramel-like aroma in darker versions or a light toffee
      character in paler versions. May have moderate to strong fruitiness, often with a dark- or dried-fruit character,
      particularly in dark versions. The hop aroma may range from mild to assertive, and is typically floral, earthy, or
      marmalade-like. Alcohol aromatics may be low to moderate, but are soft and rounded. The intensity of these
      aromatics often subsides with age. The aroma may have a rich character including bready, toasty, toffee, and/or
      molasses notes. Aged versions may have a sherry-like quality, possibly vinous or port-like aromatics, and
      generally more muted malt aromas.
      Appearance: Color may range from rich gold to very dark amber or even dark brown (often has ruby highlights, but
      should not be opaque). Low to moderate off-white head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy with chill haze
      at cooler temperatures, but generally clears to good to brilliant clarity as it warms. The color may appear to
      have great depth, as if viewed through a thick glass lens. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in "legs"
      when beer is swirled in a glass.
      Flavor: Strong, intense, complex, multi-layered malt flavors ranging from bready, toffee, and biscuity in paler
      versions through nutty, deep toast, dark caramel, and/or molasses in darker versions. Moderate to high malty
      sweetness on the palate, although the finish may be moderately sweet to moderately dry (depending on aging). Some
      oxidative or vinous flavors may be present, and often complex alcohol flavors should be evident. Moderate to
      fairly high fruitiness, often with a dark- or dried-fruit character. Hop bitterness may range from just enough for
      balance to a firm presence; balance therefore ranges from malty to somewhat bitter. Pale versions are often more
      bitter, better attenuated, and might show more hop character than darker versions; however, all versions are malty
      in the balance. Low to moderately high hop flavor, often floral, earthy, or marmalade-like English varieties.
      Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although the body may decline with long
      conditioning). A smooth warmth from aged alcohol should be present. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending
      on age and conditioning.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>High-quality, well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the grist, with judicious amounts of
      caramel malts. Dark malts should be used with great restraint, if at all, as most of the color arises from a
      lengthy boil. English hops such as Northdown, Target, East Kent Goldings and Fuggles are typical. Characterful
      British yeast.

    <NOTES>Moderate coffee-like aroma. Slight chocolate, cocoa or roasted grain notes. Some bitterness but no hop aroma.
      Dry finish.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate coffee-like aroma typically dominates; may have slight dark chocolate, cocoa and/or roasted
      grain secondary notes. Esters medium-low to none. Hop aroma low to none, may be lightly earthy or floral, but is
      typically absent.
      Appearance: Jet black to very deep brown with garnet highlights in color. According to Guinness, "Guinness beer
      may appear black, but it is actually a very dark shade of ruby." Opaque. A thick, creamy, long-lasting, tan- to
      brown-colored head is characteristic when served on nitro, but don't expect the tight, creamy head on a bottled
      beer.
      Flavor: Moderate roasted grain or malt flavor with a medium to high hop bitterness. The finish can be dry and
      coffee-like to moderately balanced with a touch of caramel or malty sweetness. Typically has coffee-like flavors,
      but also may have a bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate character in the palate, lasting into the finish.
      Balancing factors may include some creaminess, medium-low to no fruitiness, and medium to no hop flavor (often
      earthy). The level of bitterness is somewhat variable, as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish;
      allow for interpretation by brewers.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium-full body, with a somewhat creamy character (particularly when served with a
      nitro pour). Low to moderate carbonation. For the high hop bitterness and significant proportion of dark grains
      present, this beer is remarkably smooth. May have a light astringency from the roasted grains, although harshness
      is undesirable.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Guinness is made using roasted barley, flaked barley, and pale malt, but other breweries don't
      necessarily use roasted barley; they can use chocolate or other dark and specialty malts. Whatever combination of
      malts or grains is used, the resulting product should be black. Cork-type stouts are perhaps closer to historical
      London-type stouts in composition with a varied grist not dominated by roasted barley.

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate to moderately low bready, biscuity, and toasty malt aroma with mild roastiness, and may
      have a chocolate quality. May also show some non-roasted malt character in support (caramelly, nutty, toffee-like
      and/or sweet). May have up to a moderate level of floral or earthy hops. Fruity esters moderate to none. Diacetyl
      low to none.
      Appearance: Light brown to dark brown in color, often with ruby highlights when held up to light. Good clarity,
      although may approach being opaque. Moderate off-white to light tan head with good to fair retention.
      Flavor: Moderate bready, biscuity, and toasty malt flavor includes a mild to moderate roastiness (frequently with
      a chocolate character) and often a significant caramel, nutty, and/or toffee character. May have other secondary
      flavors such as coffee, licorice, biscuits or toast in support. Should not have a significant burnt or harsh
      roasted flavor, although small amounts may contribute a bitter chocolate complexity. Earthy or floral hop flavor
      moderate to none. Medium-low to medium hop bitterness will vary the balance from slightly malty to slightly
      bitter. Usually fairly well-attenuated, although can be somewhat sweet. Diacetyl moderately-low to none. Moderate
      to low fruity esters.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Moderately-low to moderately-high carbonation. Light to moderate creamy
      texture.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Grists vary, but something producing a dark color is always involved. Chocolate or other dark-roasted

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Mild roasted grain aroma, sometimes with coffee and/or chocolate notes. An impression of cream-like
      sweetness often exists. Fruitiness can be low to moderately high. Diacetyl low to none. Hop aroma low to none,
      with floral or earthy notes.
      Appearance: Very dark brown to black in color. Can be opaque (if not, it should be clear). Creamy tan to brown
      head.
      Flavor: Dark roasted grain/malt impression with coffee and/or chocolate flavors dominate the palate. Hop
      bitterness is moderate. Medium to high sweetness provides a counterpoint to the roasted character and hop
      bitterness, and lasts into the finish. Low to moderate fruity esters. Diacetyl low to none. The balance between
      dark grains/malts and sweetness can vary, from quite sweet to moderately dry and somewhat roasty.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-full to full-bodied and creamy. Low to moderate carbonation. High residual sweetness from
      unfermented sugars enhances the full-tasting mouthfeel.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>The sweetness in most Sweet Stouts comes from a lower bitterness level than most other stouts and a
      high percentage of unfermentable dextrins. Lactose, an unfermentable sugar, is frequently added to provide
      additional residual sweetness. Base of pale malt, and may use roasted barley, black malt, chocolate malt, crystal
      malt, and adjuncts such as maize or brewing sugars.

    <NOTES>Rich, deep and complex with variable amounts of roasted grains, maltiness, hop bitterness and alcohol. Very

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Rich and complex, with variable amounts of roasted grains, maltiness, fruity esters, hops, and
      alcohol. The roasted malt character can take on coffee, dark chocolate, or slightly burnt tones and can be light
      to moderately strong. The malt aroma can be subtle to rich and barleywine-like. May optionally show a slight
      specialty malt character (e.g., caramel), but this should only add complexity and not dominate. Fruity esters may
      be low to moderately strong, and may take on a complex, dark fruit (e.g., plums, prunes, raisins) character. Hop
      aroma can be very low to quite aggressive, and may contain any hop variety. An alcohol character may be present,
      but shouldn't be sharp, hot, or solventy. Aged versions may have a slight vinous or port-like quality, but
      shouldn't be sour. The balance can vary with any of the aroma elements taking center stage. Not all possible
      aromas described need be present; many interpretations are possible. Aging affects the intensity, balance and
      smoothness of aromatics.
      Appearance: Color may range from very dark reddish-brown to jet black. Opaque. Deep tan to dark brown head.
      Generally has a well-formed head, although head retention may be low to moderate. High alcohol and viscosity may
      be visible in "legs" when beer is swirled in a glass.
      Flavor: Rich, deep, complex and frequently quite intense, with variable amounts of roasted malt/grains, maltiness,
      fruity esters, hop bitterness and flavor, and alcohol. Medium to aggressively high bitterness. Medium-low to high
      hop flavor (any variety). Moderate to aggressively high roasted malt/grain flavors can suggest bittersweet or
      unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, and/or strong coffee. A slightly burnt grain, burnt currant or tarry character may
      be evident. Fruity esters may be low to intense, and can take on a dark fruit character (raisins, plums, or
      prunes). Malt backbone can be balanced and supportive to rich and barleywine-like, and may optionally show some
      supporting caramel, bready or toasty flavors. The palate and finish can vary from relatively dry to moderately
      sweet, usually with some lingering roastiness, hop bitterness and warming character. The balance and intensity of
      flavors can be affected by aging, with some flavors becoming more subdued over time and some aged, vinous or
      port-like qualities developing.
      Mouthfeel: Full to very full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although the body may decline
      with long conditioning). Gentle smooth warmth from alcohol should be present and noticeable, but not a primary
      characteristic; in well-conditioned versions, the alcohol can be deceptive. Should not be syrupy or
      under-attenuated. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Well-modified pale malt, with generous quantities of roasted malts and/or grain. May have a complex

    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate malt aroma, which can be a combination of toasty, biscuity, or nutty, possibly with a touch
      of light caramel or honey. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness with an orange- or pear-like character. Low to
      moderate strength hop character (spicy, herbal, or floral) optionally blended with background level peppery, spicy
      phenols. The hop character is lower in balance than the malt and fruitiness.
      Appearance: Three main variations exist (blond, amber and brown), so color can range from golden-blonde to
      reddish-bronze to chestnut brown. Clarity is brilliant to fair, although haze is not unexpected in this type of
      often unfiltered beer. Well-formed head, generally white to off-white (varies by beer color), average persistence.
      Flavor: Has an initial soft, smooth, moderately malty flavor with a variable profile of toasty, biscuity, nutty,
      light caramel and/or honey notes. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness, sometimes orange- or pear-like.
      Relatively light (medium-low to low) spicy, herbal, or floral hop character. The hop bitterness is medium-high to
      medium-low, and is optionally enhanced by low to very low amounts of peppery phenols. There is a dry to balanced
      finish, with hops becoming more pronounced in the aftertaste of those with a drier finish. Fairly well balanced
      overall, with no single component being high in intensity; malt and fruitiness are more forward initially with a
      supportive bitterness and drying character coming on late.
      Mouthfeel: Medium to medium-light (lean) body, often with a smooth, creamy-silky character. Moderate to high
      carbonation. Moderate alcohol warming, but should be very smooth and never hot.

    <PROFILE>Aroma: Complex, rich-sweet malty aroma, possibly with hints of chocolate, caramel and/or toast (but never
      roasted or burnt aromas). Moderate fruity esters (usually including raisins and plums, sometimes also dried
      cherries). Esters sometimes include banana or apple. Spicy phenols and higher alcohols are common (may include
      light clove and spice, peppery, rose-like and/or perfumy notes). Spicy qualities can be moderate to very low.
      Alcohol, if present, is soft and never hot or solventy. Low to no spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma, typically
      absent. The malt is most prominent in the balance with esters and a touch of alcohol in support, blending together
      for a harmonious presentation.
      Appearance: Dark amber to copper in color, with an attractive reddish depth of color. Generally clear. Large,
      dense, and long-lasting creamy off-white head.
      Flavor: Similar qualities as aroma. Rich, complex medium to medium-full rich-sweet malt flavor on the palate yet
      finishes moderately dry. Complex malt, ester, alcohol and phenol interplay (raisiny flavors are common; dried
      fruit flavors are welcome; clove or pepper spiciness is optional). Balance is always toward the malt. Medium-low
      bitterness that doesn't persist into the aftertaste. Low spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor is optional and not
      usually present.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium-high carbonation, which can influence the perception of body. Low alcohol
      warmth. Smooth, never hot or solventy.

    <NOTES>Complex with moderate spiciness ad fruitiness. Some peppery, clove-like phenols, light citrus or banana
      character. Light floral, perfumy hop aroma. Medium body, highly carbonated, dry finish.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Complex bouquet with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate fruity esters and low alcohol and
      hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery, sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus fruits
      such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes
      perfumy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in intensity. The malt character is
      light, with a soft, slightly grainy-sweet or slightly honey-like impression. The best examples have a seamless,
      harmonious interplay between the yeast character, hops, malt, and alcohol.
      Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity. Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head
      resulting in characteristic Belgian lace on the glass as it fades.
      Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a soft, rounded grainy-sweet malt impression,
      occasionally with a very light honey note. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character. Esters are
      reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes lemon, and are low to moderate. A low to moderate spicy
      hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy, and low in intensity. Bitterness is typically medium to
      high from a combination of hop bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and bitterness
      lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste with substantial spicy-fruity yeast character. The
      grainy-sweet malt flavor does not imply any residual sweetness.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial gravity would suggest. Highly
      carbonated. The alcohol content is deceptive, and has little to no obvious warming sensation. Always effervescent.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Pilsner malt, typically with pale sugar adjuncts. Saazer-type hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly
      used. Belgian yeast strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols –
      often aided by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if
      used, should be a background character only. Fairly soft water.

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Complex, with a rich-sweet malty presence, significant esters and alcohol, and an optional light to
      moderate spiciness. The malt is rich and strong, and can have a deep bready-toasty quality often with a deep
      caramel complexity. The fruity esters are strong to moderately low, and can contain raisin, plum, dried cherry,
      fig or prune notes. Spicy phenols may be present, but usually have a peppery quality not clove-like; light vanilla
      is possible. Alcohols are soft, spicy, perfumy and/or rose-like, and are low to moderate in intensity. Hops are
      not usually present (but a very low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma is acceptable). No dark/roast malt aroma.
      No hot alcohols or solventy aromas.
      Appearance: Deep amber to deep coppery-brown in color (dark in this context implies more deeply colored than
      golden). Huge, dense, moussy, persistent cream- to light tan-colored head. Can be clear to somewhat hazy.
      Flavor: Similar to aroma (same malt, ester, phenol, alcohol, and hop comments apply to flavor as well). Moderately
      malty-rich on the palate, which can have a sweet impression if bitterness is low. Usually moderately dry to dry
      finish, although may be up to moderately sweet. Medium-low to moderate bitterness; alcohol provides some of the
      balance to the malt. Generally malty-rich balance, but can be fairly even with bitterness. The complex and varied
      flavors should blend smoothly and harmoniously. The finish should not be heavy or syrupy.
      Mouthfeel: High carbonation but not sharp. Smooth but noticeable alcohol warmth. Body can range from medium-light
      to medium-full and creamy. Most are medium-bodied.

    <NOTES>Quite aromatic, with fruity, spicy and hoppy character. Spice notes are typically peppery rather than
      clove-like. Medium fruity and spicy taste. Some sourness can be present. Very dry finish and very high
      carbonation. The Saison was typically attributed to be a farmers beer, while the Grisette, which is a bit lighter,
      was more of a miner and factory worker beer.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Quite aromatic, with fruity, spicy, and hoppy characteristics evident. The esters can be fairly high
      (moderate to high), and are often reminiscent of citrus fruits such as oranges or lemons. The hops are low to
      moderate and are often spicy, floral, earthy, or fruity. Stronger versions can have a soft, spicy alcohol note
      (low intensity). Spicy notes are typically peppery rather than clove-like, and can be up to moderately-strong
      (typically yeast-derived). Subtle, complementary herb or spice additions are allowable, but should not dominate.
      The malt character is typically slightly grainy in character and low in intensity. Darker and stronger versions
      will have more noticeable malt, with darker versions taking characteristics associated with grains of that color
      (toasty, biscuity, caramelly, chocolate, etc.). In versions where sourness is present instead of bitterness, some
      of the sour character can be detected (low to moderate).
      Appearance: Pale versions are often a distinctive pale orange but may be pale golden to amber in color (gold to
      amber-gold is most common). Darker versions may run from copper to dark brown. Long-lasting, dense, rocky white to
      ivory head resulting in characteristic Belgian lace on the glass as it fades. Clarity is poor to good, though haze
      is not unexpected in this type of unfiltered beer. Effervescent.
      Flavor: Medium-low to medium-high fruity and spicy flavors, supported by a low to medium soft malt character,
      often with some grainy flavors. Bitterness is typically moderate to high, although sourness can be present in
      place of bitterness (both should not be strong flavors at the same time). Attenuation is extremely high, which
      gives a characteristic dry finish essential to the style; a Saison should never finish sweet. The fruity character
      is frequently citrusy (orange or lemon), and the spices are typically peppery. Allow for a range of balance in the
      fruity-spicy characteristics; this is often driven by the yeast selection. Hop flavor is low to moderate, and
      generally spicy or earthy in character. The balance is towards the fruity, spicy, hoppy character, with any
      bitterness or sourness not overwhelming these flavors. Darker versions will have more malt character, with a range
      of flavors derived from darker malts (toasty, bready, biscuity, chocolate, etc.) that support the fruity-spicy
      character of the beer (roasted flavors are not typical). Stronger versions will have more malt flavor in general,
      as well as a light alcohol impression. Herbs and spices are completely optional, but if present should be used in
      moderation and not detract from the yeast character. The finish is very dry and the aftertaste is typically bitter
      and spicy. The hop bitterness can be restrained, although it can seem accentuated due to the high attenuation
      levels.
      Mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Alcohol sensation varies with strength, from none in table version to light in
      standard versions, to moderate in super versions. However, any warming character should be fairly low. Very high
      carbonation with an effervescent quality. There is enough prickly acidity on the tongue to balance the very dry
      finish. In versions with sourness, a low to moderate tart character can add a refreshing bite, but not be
      puckering (optional).
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Not typically spiced, with the yeast, hops and grain providing the character; but spices are allowed if
      they provide a complementary character. Continental base malts are typical, but the grist frequently contains
      other grains such as wheat, oats, rye, or spelt. Adjuncts such as sugar and honey can also serve to add complexity
      and dry out the beer. Darker versions will typically use richer, darker malts, but not typically roasted types.
      Saazer-type, Styrian or East Kent Golding hops are commonly used. A wide range of herbs or spices can add
      complexity and uniqueness, but should always meld well with the yeast and hop character. Can have some
      brettanomyces.

    <NOTES>Moderate to high hop aroma of floral, spicy-peppery or citrus-orange aroma. Can have some grassy dry-hop
      aroma. Assertive bitterness with low to medium malt flavour. Dry finish.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: A moderate to moderately-high hop aroma of floral, spicy-peppery or citrus-orange in nature is
      typical. A slightly grassy dry-hop aroma is acceptable, but not required. A moderately-low caramel-like or toasty
      malt presence is optional. Low to moderate fruitiness is acceptable. Some versions may have a sulfury note,
      although this character is not mandatory.
      Appearance: Color ranges from golden to deep amber, but most are fairly pale. Should be clear, although unfiltered
      dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Moderate-sized, persistent head stand with off-white color.
      Flavor: Hop flavor is medium to high, with a moderate to assertive hop bitterness. The hop flavor should be
      similar to the aroma (floral, spicy-peppery, citrus-orange, and/or slightly grassy). Malt flavor should be
      medium-low to medium, and be somewhat bready, optionally with light to medium-light biscuit-like, toasty,
      toffee-like and/or caramelly aspects. Medium-low to medium fruitiness. Finish is medium-dry to very dry, and the
      bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. The balance is toward the hops, but the malt
      should still be noticeable in support. If high sulfate water is used, a distinctively minerally, dry finish, some
      sulfur flavor, and a lingering bitterness are usually present. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger
      versions. Oak is inappropriate in this style.
      Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without hop-derived astringency, although moderate to
      medium-high carbonation can combine to render an overall dry sensation despite a supportive malt presence. A low,
      smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in stronger (but not all) versions.

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: A prominent to intense hop aroma featuring one or more characteristics of American or New World
      hops, such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Many versions
      are dry hopped and can have an additional fresh hop aroma; this is desirable but not required. Grassiness should
      be minimal, if present. Medium malty aroma may be found in the background, with hints of caramel and toffee.
      Fruitiness from yeast may also be detected in some versions. A
      restrained alcohol note may be present, but this character should be minimal at best. Any American or New World
      hop character is acceptable; new hop varieties continue to be released and should not constrain this style.
      Appearance: Color ranges from medium gold to light reddish-amber. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped
      versions may be a bit hazy. Medium-sized, white to off-white head with good persistence.
      Flavor: Hop flavor is medium to very high, and should reflect an American or New World hop character, such as
      citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Medium-high to very high
      hop bitterness. Malt flavor should be low to medium-low, and is generally clean and grainy-malty although some
      light caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable. Low yeast-derived fruitiness is acceptable but not required. Dry
      to medium-dry finish; residual sweetness should be low to none. The bitterness and hop flavor may linger into the
      aftertaste but should not be harsh. A very light, clean alcohol flavor may be noted in stronger versions. May be
      slightly sulfury, but most examples do not exhibit this character.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harsh
      hop-derived astringency. Very light, smooth alcohol warming not a fault if it does not intrude into overall
      balance.

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Moderate to high hop aroma, often tropical, stone fruit, citrus or pine-like typical of American or
      New World hop varieties. Floral and spicy aromas are also found indicating European hops. Grassy aroma due to dry
      hopping may be present. Gentle, grainy-sweet malt aroma, with little to no caramel. Fruity esters are moderate to
      high and may include aromas of bananas, pears and apples. Light clove-like phenols may be noticeable. Belgian
      candi sugar-like aromas are sometimes present.
      Appearance: Light golden to amber in color. Off-white head is moderate to large in size and has good retention.
      Clarity is fair to quite hazy in dry hopped examples.
      Flavor: Initial flavor is moderately spicy and estery associated with Belgian yeast strains. Clove-like and
      peppery flavors are common. Banana, pear and apple flavors are also typical. Hop flavors are moderate to high in
      intensity and may reflect tropical, stone fruit, melon, citrusy, or piney American/New World varieties or floral
      and spicy Saazer-type hop flavors. Malt flavor is light and grainy-sweet, sometimes with low toasted or caramel
      malt flavor but not required. Bitterness is high and may be accentuated by spicy yeast-derived flavors. The finish
      is dry to medium-dry although some examples have a slight sweetness mixed with the lingering bitterness.
      Mouthfeel: The body is medium to light and varies due to carbonation level and adjunct use. Carbonation level is
      medium to high. Some higher alcohol versions may be warming although this may not be readily apparent.

    <NOTES>More robust version of the American IPA, with more hops and more malt. Sometimes also called Imperial IPA or
      even Triple IPA. High to absurdly high hop bitterness and aroma. Should still finish dry.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: A prominent to intense hop aroma that typically showcases American or New World hop characteristics
      (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). Most versions are dry
      hopped and can have an additional resinous or grassy aroma, although this is not absolutely required. Some clean
      malty sweetness may be found in the background. Fruitiness, either from esters or hops, may also be detected in
      some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is typical. Some alcohol can usually be noted, but it
      should not have a "hot" character.
      Appearance: Color ranges from golden to light orange-copper; most modern versions are fairly pale. Good clarity,
      although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Moderate-sized, persistent, white to off-white head.
      Flavor: Hop flavor is strong and complex, and can reflect the characteristics of modern American or New World hop
      varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). High to
      absurdly high hop bitterness. Low to medium malt flavor, generally clean and grainy-malty although low levels of
      caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable. Low to medium fruitiness is acceptable but not required. A long,
      lingering bitterness is usually present in the aftertaste but should not be harsh. Dry to medium-dry finish;
      should not finish sweet or heavy. A light, clean, smooth alcohol flavor is not a fault. Oak is inappropriate in
      this style. May be slightly sulfury, but most examples do not exhibit this character.
      Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harsh
      hop-derived astringency. Restrained, smooth alcohol warming acceptable.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Clean 2-row malt is typical as a base grain; an excessively complex grist can be distracting.
      Crystal-type malts often muddy the hop flavors, and are generally considered undesirable in significant
      quantities. Sugar or other highly fermentable adjuncts are often used to increase attenuation, as are
      lower-temperature mash rests. Can use a complex variety of hops, typically American or New World, often with
      cutting-edge profiles providing distinctive differences. Modern hops with unusual characteristics are not out of
      style. American yeast that can give a clean or slightly fruity profile.

    <NOTES>High hop aroma, often with stone fruit, tropical, citrusy or resinous character. Low dark malt aroma with
      some chocolate, coffee or toast note. Dry finish with lingering bitterness.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: A moderate to high hop aroma, often with a stone fruit, tropical, citrusy, resinous, piney, berry,
      or melon character. If dry hopped, can have an additional floral, herbal, or grassy aroma, although this is not
      required. Very low to moderate dark malt aroma, which can optionally include light chocolate, coffee, or toast
      notes. Some clean or lightly caramelly malty sweetness may be found in the background. Fruitiness, either from
      esters or from hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also
      acceptable.
      Appearance: Color ranges from dark brown to black. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be
      a bit hazy; if opaque, should not be murky. Good head stand with light tan to tan color should persist.
      Flavor: Medium-low to high hop flavor with tropical, stone fruit, melon, citrusy, berry, piney or resinous
      aspects. Medium-high to very high hop bitterness, although dark malts may contribute to the perceived bitterness.
      The base malt flavor is generally clean and of low to medium intensity, and can optionally have low caramel or
      toffee flavors. Dark malt flavors are low to medium-low; restrained chocolate or coffee flavors may be present,
      but the roasted notes should not be intense, ashy, or burnt, and should not clash with the hops. Low to moderate
      fruitiness (from yeast or hops) is acceptable but not required. Dry to slightly off-dry finish. The finish may
      include a light roast character that contributes to perceived dryness, although this is not required. The
      bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in
      stronger versions.
      Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without significant hop- or (especially) roasted
      malt-derived astringency. Dry-hopped versions may be a bit resiny. Medium carbonation. A bit of creaminess may be
      present but is not required. Some smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in stronger (but not all)
      versions.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Debittered roast malts for color and some flavor without harshness and burnt qualities; American or New
      World hop varieties that don't clash with roasted malts. Hop characteristics cited are typical of these type of
      hops; others characteristics are possible, particularly if derived from newer varietals.

    <NOTES>Intense hop aroma, typically with fruity qualities, most often tropical fruit and citrus. Clean neutral malt
      character. Perceived bitterness should be low to medium, often masked by the body. Medium finish. Full body with
      smooth character. Very hazy.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Very hoppy and fruity aroma, often with stone fruit, tropical, citrusy or resinous character. Most
      version are heavily dry-hopped.
      Appearance: Color ranges from golden to deep amber, but most are fairly pale. Very hazy.
      Flavor: The hop flavor is high to very high, and reflects the same characteristics as the aroma (emphasis on
      fruit, with ripe tropical fruit, stone fruit, and citrus being most common). The perceived bitterness can be
      somewhat low to medium-high, often being masked by the body and finish of the beer. The hop character in the
      aftertaste should not be sharp or harsh. Low to medium malt flavor, generally neutral, sometimes having a bready,
      grainy, lightly sweet flavor. Noticeable toast or caramel flavors are a flaw. Fermentation character is neutral to
      fruity, but as with the aroma, supportive of the hops. Off-dry to medium finish. Creamy, starchy, or sugary-sweet
      flavors are inappropriate, although a high ester level and lower bitterness may give the impression of up to
      moderate sweetness. A moderate, supportive alcohol character is acceptable but should never be hot or dominating.
      Mouthfeel: Medium to medium-full body with a smooth character. No harsh, hop-derived astringency. Alcohol warmth
      may be present in stronger versions, but should never be hot. Medium carbonation is standard. The beer should not
      have a creamy or viscous mouthfeel, an acidic twang, or a raw starch texture.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Similar to many newer American IPAs but often with more oats or wheat in the grist, and less caramel or
      specialty malts. Restricted hop choice to American or New World varieties with a tropical fruit, stone fruit, or
      citrus character. Neutral to estery yeast strain. Water ranges from balanced between sulfate and chloride to using
      more chlorides. Heavily dry-hopped, partly during active fermentation, using a variety of hopping doses and
      temperatures to emphasis hop depth of aroma and flavor over bitterness. Biotransformation of hop oils during
      fermentation may add to the fruit character.

    <NOTES>Lighter, more 'sessionable' version of an American IPA.</NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: A prominent to intense hop aroma featuring one or more characteristics of American or New World
      hops, such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Many versions
      are dry hopped and can have an additional fresh hop aroma; this is desirable but not required. Grassiness should
      be minimal, if present. A low to medium-low clean, grainy-malty aroma may be found in the background. Fruitiness
      from yeast may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also acceptable.
      Appearance: Color ranges from medium gold to light reddish-amber. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped
      versions may be a bit hazy. Medium-sized, white to off-white head with good persistence.
      Flavor: Hop flavor is medium to very high, and should reflect an American or New World hop character, such as
      citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Medium-high to very high
      hop bitterness. Malt flavor should be low, and is generally clean and grainy-malty although some light caramel or
      toasty flavors are acceptable. Low yeast-derived fruitiness is acceptable but not required. Dry to medium-dry
      finish; residual sweetness should be low to none. The bitterness and hop flavor may linger into the aftertaste but
      should not be harsh.
      Mouthfeel:Light to medium-light body. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harsh hop-derived astringency.

    <NOTES>Complex fruity and sour profile with supporting malt. Low vanilla or chocolate notes. No hop flavour. Low
      carbonation. Somewhat sweet finish.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Complex fruity-sour profile with supporting malt that often gives a wine-like impression. Fruitiness
      is high, and reminiscent of black cherries, oranges, plums or red currants. There are often low to medium-low
      vanilla and/or chocolate notes. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. The sour aroma ranges
      from balanced to intense. Prominent vinegary acetic character is inappropriate. No hop aroma. Diacetyl is
      perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary aroma.
      Appearance: Amber to deep red, burgundy to reddish-brown in color. Good clarity. White to very pale tan head.
      Average to good head retention.
      Flavor: Intense fruitiness commonly includes plum, orange, black cherry or red currant flavors. A mild vanilla
      and/or chocolate character is often present. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. Sour
      flavor ranges from complementary to intense, and can have an acidic bite. Malty flavors range from complementary
      to prominent, and often have a soft toasty-rich quality. Generally as the sour character increases, the malt
      character blends to more of a background flavor (and vice versa). No hop flavor. Restrained hop bitterness. An
      acidic, tannic bitterness is often present in low to moderate amounts, and adds an aged red wine-like character
      and finish. Prominent vinegary acetic character is inappropriate. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor
      quantities, if at all, as a complementary flavor. Balanced to the malt side, but dominated by the fruity, sour,
      wine-like impression.
      Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Low to medium astringency, like a well-aged red wine, often
      with a prickly acidity. Deceivingly light and crisp on the palate although a somewhat sweet finish is not
      uncommon.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>A base of Vienna and/or Munich malts, light to medium cara-malts, and a small amount of Special B are
      used with up to 20% maize. Low alpha acid continental hops are commonly used (avoid high alpha or distinctive
      American hops). Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus and Brettanomyces (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation
      and eventual flavor.

    <NOTES>Gueuzes have a moderate sour aroma blending with notes of barnyard, leather, earth and hay, while lambics are
      decidedly sour. Balanced sourness with some fruitiness. No hop aroma. Hops used for anti-bacterial property rather
      than bittering. In lambics, fruits are often added, giving a more fruity to definitively fruity flavour.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: A moderately sour aroma blends with aromas described as barnyard, leather, earthy, goaty, hay,
      horsey, and horse blanket. While some may be more dominantly sour, balance is the key and denotes a better gueuze.
      Commonly fruity with aromas of citrus fruits (often grapefruit), apples or other light fruits, rhubarb, or honey.
      A very mild oak aroma is considered favorable. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. No
      hop aroma.
      Appearance: Golden color, with excellent clarity and a thick, rocky, mousse-like, white head that seems to last
      forever. Always effervescent.
      Flavor: Young examples are often noticeably lactic-sour, but aging can bring this character more in balance with
      the malt, wheat and barnyard characteristics. A moderately sour character is classically in balance with the malt,
      wheat and barnyard characteristics. A low, complementary sweetness may be present but higher levels are not
      traditional. While some may be more dominantly sour, balance is the key and denotes a better gueuze. A varied
      fruit flavor is common, and can have a honey-like character. A mild vanilla and/or oak flavor is occasionally
      noticeable. The malt is generally low and bready-grainy. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable.
      Hop bitterness is generally absent but a very low hop bitterness may occasionally be perceived; sourness provides
      most of the balance. Crisp, dry, and tart finish. No hop flavor.
      Mouthfeel: Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the many mouth-filling flavors
      prevent the beer from feeling like water. Has a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply
      astringent. Some versions have a light warming character. Highly carbonated.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged hops (3 years) are used. The aged hops are used more for
      preservative effects than bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditionally
      these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally occurring yeast and bacteria in predominately oaken
      barrels. The barrels used are old and have little oak character, so don't expect a fresh or forward oak character
      – more neutral is typical. Home-brewed and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of
      yeast commonly including Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus in an attempt to recreate the
      effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and the surrounding countryside of the Senne River valley. Cultures
      taken from bottles are sometimes used but there is no simple way of knowing what organisms are still viable.

      funk. Light body and very dry finish. Often served with syrup.
    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: A sharply sour character is dominant (moderate to moderately-high). Can have up to a moderately
      fruity character (often lemony or tart apple). The fruitiness may increase with age and a light flowery character
      may develop. No hop aroma. The wheat may present as uncooked bread dough in fresher versions; combined with the
      acidity, may suggest sourdough bread. May optionally have a restrained funky Brettanomyces character.
      Appearance: Very pale straw in color. Clarity ranges from clear to somewhat hazy. Large, dense, white head with
      poor retention. Always effervescent.
      Flavor: Clean lactic sourness dominates and can be quite strong. Some complementary doughy, bready or grainy wheat
      flavor is generally noticeable. Hop bitterness is undetectable; sourness provides the balance rather than hops.
      Never vinegary. A restrained citrusy-lemony or tart apple fruitiness may be detected. Very dry finish. Balance
      dominated by sourness, but some malt flavor should be present. No hop flavor. May optionally have a restrained
      funky Brettanomyces character.
      Mouthfeel: Light body. Very high carbonation. No sensation of alcohol. Crisp, juicy acidity.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Wheat malt content is typically 50% of the grist (as is tradition with all German wheat beers) with the
      remainder typically being Pilsner malt. A symbiotic fermentation with top-fermenting yeast and Lactobacillus
      (various strains) provides the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during
      fermentation and by extended cool aging. Hop bitterness is non-existent. Decoction mashing with mash hopping is
      traditional. German brewing scientists believe that Brettanomyces is essential to get the correct flavor profile,
      but this character is never strong.

    </NOTES>
    <PROFILE>Aroma: Light to moderately fruity aroma of pome fruit. Light sourness, slightly sharp. Noticeable
      coriander, which can have an aromatic lemony quality, and an intensity up to moderate. Light bready, doughy,
      yeasty character like uncooked sourdough bread. The acidity and coriander can give a bright, lively impression.
      The salt may be perceived as a very light, clean sea breeze character or just a general freshness, if noticeable
      at all.
      Appearance: Unfiltered, with a moderate to full haze. Moderate to tall sized white head with tight bubbles and
      good retention. Effervescent. Medium yellow color.
      Flavor: Moderate to restrained but noticeable sourness, like a squeeze of lemon in iced tea. Moderate
      bready/doughy malt flavor. Light to moderate fruity character of pome fruit, stone fruit, or lemons. Light to
      moderate salt character, up to the threshold of taste; the salt should be noticeable (particularly in the initial
      taste) but not taste overtly salty. Low bitterness, no hop flavor. Dry, fully-attenuated finish, with acidity not
      hops balancing the malt. Acidity can be more noticeable in the finish, and enhance the refreshing quality of the
      beer. The acidity should be balanced, not forward (although historical versions could be very sour).
      Mouthfeel: High to very high carbonation, effervescent. Medium-light to medium-full body. Salt may give a slightly
      tingly, mouthwatering quality, if perceived at all. The yeast and wheat can give it a little body, but it
      shouldn't have a heavy feel.
    </PROFILE>
    <INGREDIENTS>Pilsner and wheat malt, restrained use of salt and coriander seed, lactobacillus. The coriander should
      have a fresh, citrusy (lemon or bitter orange), bright note, and not be vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like. The
      salt should have a sea salt or fresh salt character, not a metallic, iodine note.
