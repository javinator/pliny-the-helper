    <NOTES>CBC-1 has been specifically selected for Cask and Bottle Conditioning applications due to its high resistance
      to alcohol and pressure. It has a neutral flavor profile and does not metabolize maltotriose, therefore the
      original character of the beer is preserved after refermentation. The yeast will settle and form a tight mat at
      the bottom of the bottle or cask.

      typical of Belgian-style beers.
